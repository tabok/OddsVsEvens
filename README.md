<h1>The odds are even in this war of mine</h1>
The struggle between the odd and even soldiers has never been so fierce! Each battle will see even and odd 
soldiers thrown in together, all of them integers. The odd soldiers in the battlefield will fight using the 1 bits from
their binary representation, while the even soldiers will fight using their ​ 0 ​ bits. If present in the battle, soldiers
with the number ​ 0 ​ will be neutral, hence they will not be fighting for either side. But beware - there are also 
spies and saboteurs - each soldier that wears negative sign can have a negative effect on the battle’s result.

<h3>Rules:</h3>
<b>odds win</b> ​ - if the number of ​ 1s from odd soldiers is larger than the number of 0s from even soldiers<br>
<b>evens win</b> ​ - if the number of ​ 1 ​ s from odd soldiers is smaller than the number of 0s from even soldiers<br>
<b>tie</b>​ - if there is an equal number of 1s and ​ 0 s or when the battlefield is completely empty
